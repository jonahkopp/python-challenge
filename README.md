# python-challenge

Instructor said we could use a python notebook file for this submission.

I used the skip header solution from here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14257373/how-to-skip-the-headers-when-processing-a-csv-file-using-python

I used the round function for the average profit change from here:

I used solutions from the following two links to figure out how to read just the first row in a csvreader object and then reset the reader object to the first row again:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/431752/python-csv-reader-how-do-i-return-to-the-top-of-the-file

I used examples from here to help with indexing my lists in PyPoll:

I used the code on opening files in write mode and zipping lists together from our Python Activities, day 2, activity 12 (census data)
